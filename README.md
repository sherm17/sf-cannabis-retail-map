# sf-cannabis-retail-map
A web map I developed that for SF Planning Department that displays where cannabis retail storefronts
are permitted to be built. Users can search by address, parcel, or storefront
names. The UI/UX was created by created by SF Digital Services and I implemented
them on the web. The web application is responsive and mobile friendly.
ArcGIS JavaScript API 4.X was used to created this web application

The application can be viewed here - https://sfplanninggis.org/cannabisretail
